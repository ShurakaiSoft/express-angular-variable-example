# Express to Angular test

This is a quick test to compare different ways to pass JavaScript variables from
Express to Angular.

There are three ways to do this, that I know of...

* Create the variable in a script tag in the view.
* Get it as JSON from a RESTful API call
* Use ng-init

Each have their pros and contras.
